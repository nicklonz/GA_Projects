# newsfeed


Instructions

   In the HTML, look for a section element with an ID of main. Nested within it, you will find three articles.
   Using the sources array (defined below), create an app component that will recreate the section elements.

In the Creating a Newsfeed Component, you will find three article elements within the HTML section generating the newsfeed articles visible on the page.

Perform the following to complete the lab:

    
   Create an array called newsFeedData that will contain three objects with the following properties: title, tags, image, and impressions.
    Populate those objects based on those values assigned in the HTML.
    Create a NewsFeed component and pass it the newsFeedData array as props.
    The NewsFeed component will then render three articles based on properties of the objects in the newsFeedData array.
